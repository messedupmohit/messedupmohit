## 🔐 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience through labs, simulations, and capture-the-flag challenges. I enjoy breaking down security problems, analysing threats, and continuously improving my defensive skills through practical learning.

I focus on **blue team fundamentals**, **incident response thinking**, and **security monitoring concepts**, with a strong interest in **SOC operations**.
